# For using git


This project is only used for learning how to work with git

X
To use the NEST CLI you must install this:
``` sh
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

## TODOS
- commit this to main branch
- rebase this so who makes `dev` can see the changes
- create a feat branch from `dev` with name `feat/cat`
- create a feat branch from `dev` with name `feat/chicken`
- add a new crud for cats so they can say meow and for chicken to say bawk
- before commit both modify the main.ts to have a function that returns -1;
- both add a file in root called .someconfig and add some random text to this
- meanwhile modify branch `main`s to listen on port 3001

``` sh
nest g resource <resourec_name>
```

- Solve the following problem:
  - you must update `feat/cat` with `main` first


- commit the newly created feature to the `feat/cat` and `feat/chicken`
- rebase or merge it back to `dev` with PR?
- rebase or merge the `dev` back to `main`

# Advanced?
- revert `dev` or `main` because `feat/cat` broke the productions ðŸ˜‚
